Once upon a time, no, wait, on a land far away?… no … on a mountain? sure! 
On a mountain far away, it was 5:00am
and the animals started to wake up.
All the animals were happy
because it was the Forest’s two hundredth birthday.  
The animals were making yummy food like cookies and cake. 
And they brought yummy food to the Forest's birthday party
