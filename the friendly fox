Once upon a time, no, wait, on a land far away?… no … on a mountain? sure! 
On a mountain far away, it was 5:00am
and the animals started to wake up.
All the animals were happy
because it was the Forest’s two hundredth birthday.  
The animals were happily making yummy food like cookies and cake. 
Other animals were making, packing and wrapping gifts for the wise old tree.
They were even decorating the forest, but the grumpy fox was mean to the animals. 
He took cookies and ate them.  He took gifts and opened them.  
He even took decorations off the trees! 
The wisdom old tree saw this and asked the fox fox why he did this. 
The fox said "because I don't have any friends and nobody invited me to your birthday
party." The tree said "everybody was invited to my birthday party and the reason you don't
have any friends is because you are mean to everyone. 
"Please, wise tree, teach me how to earn friends, as I am very lonely," said the fox.
"Well, first of all, you will want to apologize to the others for opening the presents
 that were not yours to open," said the tree. So the fox went to the others and appologized 
 for opening the presents that were not his. "Next," said the tree, "you will need to rewrap those presents."
 And the fox busily went about doing just that. Once the fox was finished, the tree instructed him to hang 
 the decorations back on the tree, which he also did.
